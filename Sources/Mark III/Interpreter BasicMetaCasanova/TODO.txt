Jarno: comments dont work.
      Try to parse a TypeRule or a normal rule. 
      Make the rule parser also parse TypeRules.



Francesco:
  1. Test function call with nested constructors.
  2. Implement the check of a full premise and conclusion. The former should check the function call and check that the returned value matches
     the function return type. The latter should run the function check with the flag to generate the local variables and check that the returned
     expression matches the function return type.
