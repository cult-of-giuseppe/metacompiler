**Assignment**
Change the rule definitions of the file

"..\Content\Wiskunde 7 herkansing\transform.mc"

in order to implement the logic of:
- addition
- multiplication
- exponentiation


**Execution**
To run the program, simply execute "Run.exe"; this will show errors in case of mistakes or the program output in case of a correct program.


**Testing and scoring**
Copy and paste the following code into the file mentioned above in order to determine whether or not the first exercise is correctly executed. If a "+2" appears on the screen upon execution, then the addition exercise is correct and you get two points:

z + z => z
sz + sz => ssz
ssz + sz => sssz
--------------------------------
run => "Addition: +2"


Copy and paste the following code into the file mentioned above in order to determine whether or not the second exercise is correctly executed. If a "+4" appears on the screen upon execution, then the multiplication exercise is correct and you get four points:

z * sz => z
ssz * sz => ssz
ssz * ssz => ssssz
--------------------------------
run => "Multiplication: +4"


Copy and paste the following code into the file mentioned above in order to determine whether or not the first exercise is correctly executed. If a "+4" appears on the screen upon execution, then the exponentiation exercise is correct and you get four points:

sssz ^ z => sz
sssz ^ ssz => sssssssssz
ssz ^ sssz => ssssssssz
--------------------------------
run => "Exponentiation: +4"
